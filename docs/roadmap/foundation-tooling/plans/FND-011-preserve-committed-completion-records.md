## Context

The current `open` state conflates a newly authored plan with one the user has reviewed and deliberately authorised for execution. Manual acceptance then proves a completed plan is ready to close, but immediate removal leaves no dedicated committed record of its outcome in the normal plan lifecycle.

FND-004, FND-005, and FND-009 demonstrated the desired history manually: first commit a reviewable `done` record, then remove related completed plans and their roadmap items together at the end of the work tranche.

## Current state

The lifecycle is `open` → `in-progress` → `acceptance` → transient `done`. A plan begins `open` immediately on creation and can therefore be executed without a distinct ready-to-start decision. The plan format permits transient `status: done`, while the documented `ki-plan done` procedure removes the plan, local roadmap reference, canonical item, and generated projections in one transaction.

The roadmap validator accepts `done` but does not require a `## Done` outcome. The generated active-plan index can render a `done` plan, as the recorded transition demonstrated; it has no batch-pruning operation. `prune` is not, and must not become, a plan status: it is an explicit operation over already-done records.

## Steps

1. Define the visible lifecycle as `open` → `ready` → `in-progress` → `acceptance` → `done`. `open` is a newly authored or materially revised plan awaiting a user's explicit readiness decision; `ready` is reviewed, unblocked, and eligible for execution; `execute` moves it to `in-progress`. `prune` is an operation, not a plan state.
2. Add a guarded `ready` transition: require the user's explicit approval to start, retain the plan and roadmap item unchanged apart from status and derived projections, reject unresolved blockers, and return a materially revised plan to `open` for renewed review. Update plan creation, promotion, status display, and execution guidance to make that boundary visible.
3. Extend the plan format and roadmap validator with `ready`, including dependency rules that prevent a ready, in-progress, or acceptance plan from bypassing a non-done blocker. Keep `done` as a visible terminal record, not an implicit pruning request.
4. Define the durable closing operations: `done` transitions an accepted plan to a committed record without deletion and with one non-empty terminal `## Done` H2 after its acceptance packet; explicit `prune` later discovers and removes eligible `done` plans in the requested scope.
5. Specify `prune` scope and safety: list candidate plan identifiers and canonical items before writing; accept an optional theme scope or the full thematic set; require the done records to be committed; and leave non-done, blocked, malformed, or concurrently changed plans untouched with an exact diagnostic.
6. Update `ki-plan` lifecycle guidance and user-facing help for the three guarded transitions: `ready` records start approval, `done` records closure and commits, and `prune` removes the selected plans, canonical items/references, dependency edges, and projections through one separate no-clobber transaction and commit.
7. Add focused fixtures for invalid ready transitions, status visibility, revised-plan re-review, dependency blocking, missing or malformed done outcomes, correct done-record index visibility, full and theme-scoped batch pruning, dependency cleanup, repeated requests, uncommitted records, concurrent mutation, and rollback boundaries.
8. Refresh vendored roadmap payloads and generated projections, document the distinct ready, done, and prune commit boundaries, and run focused and serial repository gates.

## Verify

- A newly created or materially revised plan is `open`; only explicit user approval moves it to `ready`, and only a ready plan may begin execution.
- `ready` is visible in plan status and the generated index, preserves the canonical item and plan contents, and cannot bypass an unresolved dependency.
- `done` turns an accepted plan into a valid, indexed `done` plan only with a non-empty `## Done` outcome and does not delete it.
- A later `prune` can remove multiple eligible done plans together, either repository-wide or within one theme, while preserving unrelated active plans and authored roadmap prose.
- Prune rejects uncommitted done records, malformed plans, non-done plans, unsafe paths, and concurrent changes without partial publication.
- Repeated, malformed, unsafe, and concurrently changed states fail closed without partial publication.

## Dependencies / blocks

This plan formalises the explicit ready-to-start gate and the committed completion-record workflow exercised manually for FND-004, FND-005, and FND-009. It is independent of FND-010's terminal-progress presentation work.
