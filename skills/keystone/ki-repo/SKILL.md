# Knowledge Islands repo

You are helping hold git repos to one **Knowledge Islands repo standard** — how a repo is _set up_, not what its code does. A **Knowledge Islands repo is a git repo that carries a `.ki-config.toml`** — that file's presence is the compliance marker; the standard applies to any such repo, and the [`knowledgeislands`](https://github.com/knowledgeislands) org is its reference set, not its boundary. The standard has three layers (local files, GitHub settings, deeper GitHub). Its full, quotable form with rationale and the per-repo override model lives in [the standard](references/standards.md); the generated [rubric](references/rubric.md) publishes the canonical structured items under `scripts/rubric/`; the mechanical checker is [`scripts/audit.ts`](scripts/audit.ts). The cross-cutting **`.ki-config.toml` contract** — what its presence means and how every skill reads its own table — lives in [the contract](references/config-standards.md).

This skill governs a repo's **configuration and Knowledge Islands compliance** — how a repo is set up, not its source code. It is a **standard, base-agnostic Process skill**: it hard-codes no single repo or org and discovers its targets at runtime (a local tree, or a whole org via `gh`). How it sits alongside the other skills in this repo (where they complement and where they must not overlap) is documented once in the ki-agentic-harness `README.md`, not repeated here.

## The standard at a glance

1. **Files** — every repo carries `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and `.ki-config.toml` (its declared config). Presence is checked on the default branch **via the GitHub API**, not a checkout. (`.editorconfig` is owned by `ki-authoring`, not this skill.)
2. **GitHub** (repos on github.com): default branch `main`, MIT _(public)_ / proprietary + `UNLICENSED` _(private)_, **squash-only merge + linear history**, auto-delete branch on merge, Issues **on**, Wiki & Projects **off**, a non-empty description synced with `package.json` where one exists; public repos also carry the standard topic set. **`main` is open by default** — branch protection is an _optional_ check a repo opts into (below).
3. **Deeper GitHub**: Dependabot alerts + security updates **on** everywhere; secret scanning + push protection **on** for public repos; Actions `allowed-actions = all`.

**Visibility** is **declared** per repo in `.ki-config.toml` under `[ki-repo]` (`visibility = "public" | "private"`) and checked against live GitHub — not inferred from the name. `.ki-config.toml` is a shared file whose file-level contract and foundation scaffold this skill owns; each skill defines and may conform the schema of its own `[table]`. EDUCATE scaffolds the canonical `[ki-repo]` defaults plus the required bare `[ki-authoring]` marker, preserving any config already present. Per-repo overrides live in a `[ki-repo.checks]` sub-table — one boolean per overridable check (`true` = enforce, `false` = don't); omit any to take the org default, so a fully-conforming repo writes none. `branch-protection` defaults **off** (set `true` to protect `main`); the GitHub-feature and security checks default **on** (set `false` to step out). The auditor prints each active override as a `note`, never a failure. See [the standard](references/standards.md).

**Coverage** is enforced on top of that marker — a gated cascade. Once `.ki-config.toml` confirms the repo _is_ a Knowledge Islands repo, the auditor checks that every governance standard whose applicability is _detectable_ in the repo declares its opt-in table: an `eleventy.config` expects `[ki-website]`, a `Streams/` zone expects `[ki-kb-streams]`, the MCP SDK expects `[ki-mcp]`, and so on across `engineering`, `kb`, `website-cloudflare`, `skills`, and `agents`. A detected-but-undeclared standard is a **WARN** (never a FAIL); a declared table with no matching artifact is a softer "stale?" WARN. The **gate** is what stops a false positive — a plain git repo with an 11ty config but no `.ki-config.toml` is not a Knowledge Islands repo, so coverage is skipped entirely and it simply takes the `ki-config` FAIL. Silence a deliberate non-coverage with `[ki-repo.checks]` `coverage-<skill> = false`. The cascade reads only table _presence_ across the set (presence is a compliance fact `repo` is entitled to check); it never interprets another skill's keys. See [the contract](references/config-standards.md).

## Operating modes

Every governance skill carries the universal four **AUDIT · CONFORM · EDUCATE · REFRESH**; EDUCATE here onboards a repo. Invoked as `help` / `-h` / `?`, it explains itself and stops — the generated HELP block (name, purpose, invocation, modes, off-ramps), taking no action. With no mode it does the same, then, in an interactive session only, offers the mode choice via `AskUserQuestion`, prompting for any `argument-hint` target the chosen mode shows.

### Mode AUDIT — check a repo against the standard

Auditing a whole tree or org is a set audit — **bound the context** (the set-audit discipline in `ki-skills`' enforcement framework §5): take the checker's one set-level run over every repo, then do the per-repo judgment pass **one repo at a time**, fully (its composed `engineering` / artifact-skill audits included) before moving to the next; repos are independent, so the order is free.

1. Confirm `gh` is authenticated against the org (`gh auth status`).
2. **Run the mechanical checker**: `bun scripts/audit.ts <tree-path>` (local repos, github.com-gated) or `--org <org>` (the whole org, including repos not cloned locally). With no reporter it emits the complete canonical JSONL response; add `--reporter=terminal` for the filtered human view and `--reporter-levels=all` only when diagnosing every outcome. The response uses FAIL / WARN / FIXED / INFO / NOT_APPLICABLE / PASS and exits non-zero on any mechanical FAIL. Capture its output rather than re-deriving the result.
3. **Do the judgment pass the script can't** — the `[J]` items in [the rubric](references/rubric.md): does each description actually _match the repo's purpose_ (the script now checks non-emptiness and `package.json` sync mechanically — `description` / `description-sync` — but not fit); is each per-repo override (a `note` in the output) a warranted decision rather than waved-off drift.
4. **Report** by `repo · check · fix`, lead with FAILs, surface any **coverage** WARNs (a detected standard with no opt-in table), and call out the overrides (`note`s) you judged warranted.

### Mode CONFORM — bring a repo (or the org) into line

Outward-facing: it changes live GitHub settings and may open PRs. Show the diff and confirm before mutating.

The rubric's mechanical findings are scripted: `bun scripts/conform.ts [path]` (`--dry-run` to preview) first repairs the local `.gitignore` and required config root markers, then applies every mechanical `gh` call in [the standard](references/standards.md#applying-it) directly — merge methods, auto-delete-branch, Wiki/Projects/Issues, topics, branch protection (only when `[ki-repo.checks]` opts it in), Dependabot alerts/updates, `allow_update_branch`, secret scanning + push protection (public), Actions permissions. Local repair is deliberately first, so it still converges when the repo has no GitHub remote or `gh` is unauthenticated. A missing config receives the canonical `[ki-repo]` defaults plus bare `[ki-authoring]`; a partial config receives only its missing exact root marker. Existing bytes remain an exact prefix, a second run is byte-identical, and `--dry-run` writes nothing. CONFORM does not pretend to evaluate judgment items; its summary reports how many remain for a human review.

1. Run **AUDIT** first, so you change against a known gap list.
2. Run `conform.ts` for the mechanical layer (or apply the `gh` commands in [the standard](references/standards.md) by hand).
3. Resolve the judgment items yourself — document content, description fit, runtime orientation, development links, override rationale, and standard synchronisation.
4. **Re-audit** to confirm convergence.

### Mode EDUCATE — make a repo Knowledge Islands–compliant

Onboard a repo by adding the marker file (and the other root files) so it joins the standard. Local only — no live GitHub change; hand the live settings to **CONFORM**.

1. Add any missing root files: `README.md` / `LICENSE` / `.gitignore` (`.editorconfig` is `ki-authoring`'s).
2. Run `bun scripts/educate.ts <target-repo>` (preview with `--dry-run`). EDUCATE owns the config write: a missing file gets one canonical `[ki-repo]` default block plus one bare `[ki-authoring]`; a partial file gets only whichever exact root marker is absent. A dotted sub-table such as `[ki-repo.checks]` does not satisfy the root marker. Existing values, comments, order, and all other bytes are preserved; repeat runs are idempotent.
3. EDUCATE delegates into bootstrap with `--seed ki-repo`; bootstrap invokes the same owner's internal `--scaffold-config-only` leg, then re-resolves and vendors `ki-repo`, `ki-authoring`, and the self-check runners in that same run. The documented direct `repo-bootstrap.ts <target> --seed ki-repo` route has identical behavior without embedding a TOML template in bootstrap.
4. Set `visibility` and any `[…checks]` overrides (see [the `.ki-config.toml` contract](references/config-standards.md)), commit (a direct push to `main` is fine — it's open), then run **CONFORM** for the GitHub settings.

### Mode REFRESH — re-anchor the standard to GitHub's surface

**Precondition:** REFRESH edits this skill's own canonical files, which exist only in `ki-agentic-harness`. Invoked from a repo where the skill is vendored, it stops here and names the harness as where to run it — or, for a pattern recurring across bases, routes it through `ki-kb`'s IMPROVE mode instead.

GitHub's settings surface moves (rulesets vs classic protection, new security toggles, Actions policy). Run on its declared cadence (see `references/sources.md`), or when asked "is the repo standard current".

1. **Read [the source list](references/sources.md)** — the tracked GitHub REST API / `gh` / rulesets / security-features sources, each with a `last reviewed` date.
2. **Re-fetch each** (WebFetch; fall back to WebSearch if a host is blocked or returns non-200) and **diff** against [the standard](references/standards.md) and [`scripts/audit.ts`](scripts/audit.ts): new or renamed settings, changed defaults, protection moving to rulesets, new security toggles.
3. **Scan the org** for emergent patterns the standard hasn't captured.
4. **Propose a diff** to the standard, the script, and this file; confirm before writing.
5. **Update [the source list](references/sources.md)** — bump each `last reviewed` date and refresh the `## Last review` block (what's confirmed, open watch-items). What changed goes in the commit, not a changelog. Mandatory: the source list is the skill's memory of where the standard comes from.

## Notes

- **Development linking:** `bun scripts/link-repository-commands.ts <repo> --development` is the sole explicit local-author path that creates repository-local skill symlinks. Add `--agents` to link declared Claude governance agents too. Ordinary user installation and repository bootstrap always create regular copies instead. `ki-harness` composes this command for its own development workflow.

- Requires the `gh` CLI authenticated with **repo-admin** scope to apply settings.
- `main` is **open by default** — direct pushes are allowed, so local-file fixes (EDUCATE / CONFORM step 2) can land as a direct commit. A repo overrides the `branch-protection` check on (`[…checks]` `branch-protection = true`); only then does CONFORM protect that repo's `main`.
- **Private repos**: secret scanning is plan-limited; the standard exempts it (public-only check). Revisit via **GHAS** if the org upgrades — a REFRESH follow-up.
- The auditor is **read-only**; EDUCATE and CONFORM are the write modes. CONFORM limits local mutation to mechanically confirmed gaps before it considers live GitHub changes.
- This skill owns the `.ki-config.toml` **file-level contract and foundation scaffold** (including the coverage cascade — which `[ki-*]` tables a repo declares). Other skills own and may conform their own table schemas; they must preserve unrelated tables. Wiring declared skills into the repo's project-local runtime directories and `.ki-meta/` is `ki-bootstrap`'s job. Bootstrap may subprocess this skill's scaffold-only EDUCATE when `ki-repo` is seeded or resolved, then re-read the result; it never embeds a TOML template or edits the file directly.
- Checker output conforms to the severity ladder, JSON shape, and exit-code contract in `ki-skills`' [checker contract](../../general-governance/ki-skills/references/checker-contract.md).
